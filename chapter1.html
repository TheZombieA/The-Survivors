            <p class="Chap1Story">
                It’s a normal day as any other , but right when he woke up in the morning , he didn’t see his ordinary room , he saw a fricking darkness of a room , and he didn’t know where he was .
                 Suddenly , his best friend comes out of nowhere , and says “ No time to explain , come with me! “ .
                  When he left the house he was in, he realized that the world around him has been completely destroyed.
                   When he asked his friend what happened , he only says “ zombie apocalypse , a ton of people have died , only the smartest and strongest were able to survive till now”. A zombie apocalypse? How did that happen? Well, it all started after the corona virus was stopped, everyone thought that they were safe, but it turns out that something even worse has happened.
                    A group of scientists from the US were experiencing some things on a human body, but what they feared the most… happened ; and they definitely weren’t ready for it .The human that was experienced on , suddenly turned into a monster with a green body and red glowing eyes that were starving for some human brains .
                     Now , the world is living a nightmare , almost the whole world has died and the population is getting lower by the second .
                      So they had to find a way to stop this disaster or else the planet earth will just become a world of nothingness  , and they couldn’t let that happen , all their friends , their familys , and everyone they loved will just be gone … forever! .
                       So he went back to his house and took everything that he will need , from clothes to even weapons , because he knew that this task that he has been given wouldn’t be easy . And after he got ready , he went back with his friend .
                        After some time , they arrived at their destination “ The Abandoned laboratory ” which they will consider as their new home from now on because Felis just happened to have worked there before , but he was fired due to some errors that he made in the system , ans also because it was Abandoned they knew that they would be safe at least for some time , enough time until they can be ready to face one of the worst things planet earth has experienced . 
So they started by searching the place for anything of use , they spent a lot of time , 2 days to be exact , but didn’t find anything that could help them , but right as he was giving up on the search he saw some kind of green glowing stone being held by a skeleton . So he takes it carefully from his hand in case there was any traps , after he took the stone , he showed it to his friend , and he just happened to know a use for it . 
He says “ This isn’t any ordinary stone , this is a stone that has been discovered in the 90’s , its mostly used for super powerful weapons or nuclear bombs ” .
 And that’s when he realized that he got his hands on one of the most powerful things he could find , so he kept gathering as many of them as he could find , and gathered some extra things that would help them in making the weapons needed.
  Now , its was time , they put everything that they gathered in front of them and started thinking about what they can do with it , so they spent hours even days  just trying to make something that would really help them , especially after they found that stone ; first they tried making a portal gun as way to escape the zombies if they were in any danger , but that wasn’t anything close to being an easy task , because they had to make some of the pieces from scratch like a barrel , a firing pin , a firing pin safety and even the gun frame and lots more … As time was ticking , the inventions that they were making got better and better , but that wasn’t it because there were bad news , some zombies found their way into the laboratory and it wouldn’t take long until they would be able to break in , so they had to think real quick , the portal gun wasn’t even tested so they didn’t know if they would be safe while using it , the laboratory was getting surrounded by zombies and there was no other escape route , so they just took a leap of luck , fired the gun and jumped in with all the their important stuff .
