          <h1>Other Survivors?</h1>
          <p class="Chap2Story">
            And to their surprise, the gun worked and it teleported them far
            enough to run away into the wilderness ; but , that wasn’t the end
            of the story, because they had nowhere to go and hide , and they
            were very tired , so they had to find somewhere to call home , but
            that wouldn’t be easy , because there were zombies scattered around
            the whole city , and they couldn’t do anything about it , unless
            they would fight with all of their power , but even then two people
            wouldn’t be able to end dozens of zombies by themselves , and they
            didn’t know if there were any survivors other than them , but they
            didn’t have any other options , because they were very well
            unprepared , and that can cause serious injuries or even death if
            they even dared to try . So that was it , they decided to sleep the
            night in a hidden hallway , and right as the sun rised , they
            started looking in every place possible trying to find if there were
            any survivors other than them , they spent hours even days just
            looking and looking without finding a trace or just even a clue that
            can lead into thinking there were any other survivors , but right as
            they were going to forget about this mission , they heard sounds
            screaming for help , as the sound got closer , they saw their
            classmates Jake and Lisa being attacked by zombies , so they got
            their gravity guns out , used them on the zombies wish changed their
            gravity to zero , took their friends and run as fast as they could
            because they knew that they couldn’t stay any longer or they would
            be in big trouble. Jake says while being traumatized : Oh boy ! I
            don’t know what we could’ve done if you guys didn’t help us out …
            Emma cuts him out while saying : Forget about that , most
            importantly now is that we know we aren’t alone in this monstrosity
            of a city . Felix says : It’s not time for long conversations , we
            have to think about a way to end this chaos , and we have to do it
            fast Chris says : Yes , but first we have to heal their injuries
            because they’re badly hurt , especially jake . They all agree to go
            into a hospital and try to get some bandages , they tought that
            would be easy , but what they didn’t expect is that countless
            amounts of zombies were scattered around there , so they had to find
            a way to sneak in , thankfully Felix still had the portal gun , but
            there was one slight problem , it was out of ammo , and they forgot
            to bring the ammo with them , so there was only one way to enter the
            building , and it was using one of them as a distraction so the
            others can enter the hospital safely and at the end they all meet up
            again at the laboratory . Taking the position of the distraction
            could go all wrong , but, Chris took it , because he tought even if
            he died , he would’ve died trying to save his friends . And now it
            was the moment of truth , they had the whole plan set up , it was
            only a matter of time now , so Chris took a deep breath , and came
            out to the open , the zombies looked at him for 1 second and then
            just started running at him like they never did before and that was
            time , Jake , Emma and Felix went in the hospital looking for
            bandages , it didn’t take long until they found everything they
            needed , so they used the bandages and left the hospital , and
            started going to the laboratory thinking that Chris would be there
            before them , but they were very wrong , when they arrived they
            didn’t see their friend , so they waited in case he got lost or
            something , but he didn’t come in that day , not even the second ,
            neither the third , they lost hope . They just came to the
            conclusion that he is just gone , he sacrafised himself for his
            friends . But they couldn’t be emotional at the moment , because
            they had to get ther revenge for their friend , and they couldn’t
            just stand there crying if they wanted to do that , so they got back
            to the laboratory and started again on making more weapon but this
            time they had one of the smartest people in their school in their
            team , so it was a bit easier to make what they need . So they just
            started , it didn’t take long until they had one of the most
            powerful weapons they ever made wish was a lightning bolt shooter ,
            this gun can make u a skeleton with one touch of it . So now after ,
            weeks of preparing , they were ready to take their revenge
